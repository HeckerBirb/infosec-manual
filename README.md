# The Infosec Manual
An "Open-source methodology on pentesting and risk mitigation" is a manual intended to be used as references when either seeking information on infosec risk mitigation or penetration testing. The goal of the manual is to provide easy-to-read information about how to test the security of particular services and how to further strengthen the security of these, related to the described vulnerabilities or misconfigurations.

# Work in progress
This manual is very much work in progress. Please read the "CONTRIBUTING.md" file and then see the Issues page for ideas on where to get started (or suggest other contributions entirely).
